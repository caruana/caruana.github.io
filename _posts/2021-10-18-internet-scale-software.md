> Human-centered design. Meeting people where they are and really taking their needs and feedback into account. When you let people participate in the design process, you find that they often have ingenious ideas about what would really help them. And it’s not a onetime thing; it’s an iterative process.”

Anyone, anywhere, at any time, can design, build, iterate and deliver software; software now runs the world. Software can be embedded in other software, can be one to infinite lines of code, can be science and art. Software can turn lights on, cars off, track a heartbeat, identify a face in a picture, make a decision, move capital, manage a contract and make a commitment. Software runs on your phone, your thermostat, regulates your car, keeps the electrical grid operating. Software lives in the cloud and in your house. Most importantly, software is accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time through the internet.

The internet enables anyone, anywhere, at any time to communicate, collaborate or interact with an infinite number of other people. The internet has democratized knowledge, equalized access to the tools required to deliver your ideas, organized billion plus person communities and allows any number of people to simultaneously share a common experience. In short, the internet, powered by software, has shrunk the geographically constrained world into a shared, borderless localized world of infinite possibilities. 

Code(Cayman) is a community, a theory, an experiment, an aspiration and a vision for a Cayman that fully embraces the limitless opportunities that software, the internet, a shared global experience and an active citizenship can build together. From ship building to operating a global financial services hub, Cayman is a nation that knows how to get things done. Together, we are a nation of builders, innovators, dreamers, artists, leaders, collaborators. Code(Cayman)’s ambition is to help transition this abundance of energy and ingenuity into a community that participates in designing new and better experiences for the world from our geographically confined but globally impactful #InnovationIslands by proudly declaring our software was #DesignedInCayman.
