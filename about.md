# Brandon Caruana

I believe at a marco level, everyone is a good person but under a microscope people are nuanced and operate under the pressures of their strengths and weaknesses. I am no exception, my macro view of the world is to "Win and Help Win" but sometimes my real time decisions can be interpreted as smart or arrogant.
